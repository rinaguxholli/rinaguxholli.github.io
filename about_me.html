						<h3>Academia</h3>
						<p>I'm a first-generation Albanian immigrant and student, and was taught the value of education from a very young age.</p>

						</p> My interest in ecology started during my second year Intro to Ecology course at the University of Windsor, where I completed my Honours Bsc in Biological Sciences. There, I joined the lab of Dr. Trevor Pitcher, and completed my honours thesis on the thermal effects of eDNA detection using the imperiled Redside Dace as my study species.
						</p>

					</p> Then, I moved to the Maritimes for my MScâ€“currently completing the final stages of my project at the University of New Brunswick Saint John in Dr. Scott Pavey's lab. My project is in partnership with GEN-FISH, a national project funded through a competitive grant awarded by Genome Canada. Broadly, our aim is to determine the location and abundance of Canada's 200+ freshwater fishes, and measure how they fare in the face of increasing Anthropogenic stressors. </p>

					</p> My project has developed eDNA qPCR assays using the mitochondrial Cytochrome B genetic marker for 20 freshwater fishes of ecological, economic and Indigenous importance in Atlantic Canada. I conducted eDNA field work at Fundy National Park, home of the Inner Bay of Fundy Atlantic Salmon. I applied assays I developed to eDNA samples taken at Fundy to prove their efficacy and utility as a monitoring tool for five species found in the river systems there. </p>

					</p> Although my work focuses heavily on environmental DNA and freshwater fishes, I am more broadly interested in the genetic basis behind evolutionary change, population genetics and structure, and the effects of environmental stressors on gene regulation and expression.  </p>
